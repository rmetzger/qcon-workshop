[Apache Flink<sup>&reg;</sup>](http://flink.apache.org) is an open source platform for scalable stream and batch data processing. It offers expressive APIs to define batch and streaming data flow programs and a robust and scalable engine to execute these jobs. 


### Goals and scope of this training

This training teaches how to implement scalable data analysis programs with Apache Flink 1.1.3. 

Specifically, this training teaches:

- How to setup an environment to develop Flink programs
  - Setup all required software and tools and configure an IDE
  - Create a Maven project for Flink programs and import it into an IDE
  - Execute and debug a Flink program locally in an IDE

- How to implement Flink programs using its APIs
	- Solve exercises for stream programs using the DataStream API
  
- How to package, execute, and monitor Flink programs on running Flink systems
